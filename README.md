# W101Calculator
My name is Devin, and I'm an avid W101 raid player who consistently pushes to find new challenging and fun ways to complete raids, as well as optimizing or simplifying them. I am the co-leader of the Spiral Shadows guild that took a top place in the community Spiral Cup and plans to take higher spots in guild-specific competitions.

If you are interested in joining The Spirals Shadows please add Devin#0585 or uxoas#7879 on discord (entry to the guild is more open but in game guild spots will go to the most active members)

This code will calculate any base spell damage and player-acquired damage while taking into account any and all buffs or debuffs within a small margin of error.
